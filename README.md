# Neural on GPU
The application allows you to recognize images using a video card.

## Notation
This application is aimed at performance rather than on neural networks.
There is a miscalculation of the weights of neurons on the GPU device, using OpenCL.

For correct operation it is necessary to download SDK Tool from NVIDIA, and the necessary drivers for your video card.
